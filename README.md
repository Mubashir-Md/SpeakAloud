# SpeakAloud
A webapp which can convert speech into text and then into sign language, to help people with hearing disability
This is an ongoing project which is built on HTML and JS, with backend as Flask.
For speech to text conversion Speech Recognition library is used and we extracted text from natural speech.
This comes under the category of NLP, natural language processing.
In future we are going to add a customized avatar built using Blender or any other 3D modeling software.
Also training will be done to the avatar using three.js and it can then generate sign languages according to the text
In future the website will also be implemented in Android and IOS.
Setup:
To set up, fork this repository
Now run the python file and go to the localhost "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
Thank you !
